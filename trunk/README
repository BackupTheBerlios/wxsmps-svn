Implemented features:
- Full (almost) control of mpd (update db not implemented yet).
- Full current playlist control.

TODO:
- browse mpd's music directory and append/replace songs to current playlist.
- config file for wxsmps.
- minor improvements.



1)
get wxBase from http://www.wxwidgets.org/dl_base.htm#stable

configure wxBase as following:
(tested and working here)
./configure --disable-gui --enable-unicode --enable-sockets --with-regex
make && make install

2)
compile wxsmps

g++ `wx-config --cxxflags --libs base,net` -L/usr/local/lib -lmpd *.cpp -o wxsmps

3)
Be sure to have at least lcdproc ver 0.5.0. Versions prior to that don't have the menu system implemented.
http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net/download.php3

Until an official minor upgrade release to 0.5.0 has been released (next should be 0.5.1), it is strongly recommanded to get a nightly build of the stable-0-5-x CVS branch.
http://lcdproc.sourceforge.net/nightly/

Notably a nasty bug, that lets LCDd exit unexpectedly after clients disconnect, has been corrected in the stable-0-5-x CVS. See also my bug report and the following discussion on the lcdproc mailing list.

####################### Additional note for Crystal Fontz 634 display users ###########################
Users with a CF634 display (like me :) who see weird characters on the playing screen of wxsmps will want to patch the stable-0-5-x CVS of lcdproc with the patch provided with wxsmps (in the lcdproc_related dir).

The weird characters are these:
Random on: ü instead of ~  
Repeat off: ö instead of |
Repeat on: Ñ instead of ]

(Thanks to richieb for inspiring me to include a lcdproc patch in wxsmps ;)

edit config of LCDd

have drivers enabled in that order (lirc if you have a remote of course)
Driver=lirc
Driver=CFontz
Driver=curses

If you don't have a remote you will need curses pseudo lcd to be able to "send" keys to LCDd which are forwarded to the client app wxsmps. The keys give you the possibilty to control mpd player and to browse the playlist. The playlist and the settings are implemented as LCDd client menus. In my config of LCDd the </> is the menu enter/leave key and <Return> is the confirm key.

The wxsmps client keys are currently these:
#Handy on the NumPad...
/*client keys*/
#define DEFAULT_KEY_STOP_STRING				"0"
#define DEFAULT_KEY_REPEAT_STRING			"1"
#define DEFAULT_KEY_PREV_SONG_STRING		"2"
#define DEFAULT_KEY_RANDOM_STRING			"3"
#define DEFAULT_KEY_SEEK_BACK_STRING		"4"
#define DEFAULT_KEY_PLAY_PAUSE_STRING		"5"
#define DEFAULT_KEY_SEEK_FORWARD_STRING		"6"
#define DEFAULT_KEY_NEXT_SONG_STRING		"8"
#define DEFAULT_KEY_VOL_UP_STRING			"+"
#define DEFAULT_KEY_VOL_DOWN_STRING			"*"   //lcdproc bug: does not accept "-" as client key.
#define DEFAULT_KEY_CLEAR_PLAYLIST_STRING	"."


Final Notes:

At a later release the keys and host:port values of LCDd and mpd can be set in a config file.
For now wxsmps expects to find LCDd on 127.0.0.1:13666 and mpd on 127.0.0.1:6600, which are the defaults.
